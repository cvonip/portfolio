    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m a beginner coder exploring web development and learning Jekyll! Currently, I’m pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Information Technology at Western Governors University. My ultimate goal is to become a senior software engineer at one of my dream companies like Pinterest, Microsoft, Google, or Spotify.</p>

    <p><strong>When I'm not coding or working,</strong> you can find me watching TikToks, shopping, painting, crocheting, or diving into a new creative craft.</p>
    <p>I also work full-time as a warehouse employee at Amazon, balancing both my career and education.</p>
